<p><strong>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering</strong></p>
<p><strong>EEC172 Embedded System Design Winter 2025</strong></p>
<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> This course introduces the
fundamentals of embedded system design. The course has a substantial lab
component that involves mostly software. The lab projects will use the
TI CC3200 Launchpad (see: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEERSpj3Gks">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEERSpj3Gks</a>)
as the hardware platform and will consist of developing software in
C/C++ and to connect to an external ‘thing’ (an infrared (IR) remote
controller), connect the ‘thing’ to the internet via the CC3200’s
on-chip WiFi module, and use the IR remote to ‘signal’ the internet. Our
primary connection to the internet will be through Amazon Web Services
(AWS) Internet of Things (IoT) cloud platform (see: <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot">https://aws.amazon.com/iot</a>).</p>
<p>The lecture portion of the course, various readings and videos will
cover several topics in embedded system design, as listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Computer Architecture (EEC170 or ECS
154A) and Circuits II (EEC 100). No waivers.</p>
<p><strong>Waitlist:</strong> Only students who can demonstrate that
they must take EEC172 to graduate this spring will be considered. <u>No
guarantees</u> that such students can be accommodated. Other students
are advised to enroll in the next offering (tentatively Spring 2025) of
the course.</p>

<li><p>Windows 7 desktops (one per group), campus Kerberos login
credentials</p></li>
<li><p>Encouraged to BYOL (bring you own laptop – MAC support only
recently added thanks to work done by Ryan Tsang et al.) However,
Windows system will make your life way easier.</p></li>
<li><p>No local disk storage: use a cloud drive or bring a flash drive
to save code developed on lab machines</p></li>
<li><p>You may visit the other regular lab section on a space-available
basis with the TA's OK</p></li>
<li><p>Room locked outside of scheduled lab hours, or used by another
class</p></li>
<li><p>You will have all the equipment needed to work on lab assignments
outside of the lab<br />
You should expect to do some work outside of the lab (could be most or
even all of the work done out the lab).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Groups:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>All lab projects are done in groups of two students, with students
selecting their partner. At the first lab session the TAs will assist in
pairing students who have not found a partner.</p>
<p>Collaboration beyond your group of two is not allowed.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about taking the course and might drop the course,
drop now! Do not leave a partner hanging!!</p>

<p>Different labs have different points/weights. The points allotted to
a lab are generally proportional to its level of difficulty, which
correlates with the time allotted to complete the lab.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>If late by one lab period: -15% points out of
70%</strong></p>
<p><strong>From one lab period to one week late: -30% points out of

<p><strong>At one-week late, must have system verified as is; no credit
after one-week late.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lab Report (30% points)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Description of method used to solve the problem, including
description of code structure</p>

date</strong></p>
