title: EEC172 Lab Report Instructions
---

# Overview

For each lab you will be submitting a lab report that details the
procedures and results you encountered while working on your lab.

This page outlines exactly what your report should include and contains
instructions on how it should be formatted.

**In general, your lab report should include enough information to
reproduce the lab and your results *without the lab handout* and should
demonstrate that you understand what you were learning and whether or
not you learned it.**

**This page describes only the basic components of a lab report that you
should have learned from your general education requirements and/or
prerequisite courses. If you are still confused about the components of
a lab report, please feel free to contact the course staff or consult
any of the linked resources under [Helpful Links](#helpful-links)**

## Submission

Canvas submissions should have at least 2 files:
- `report.pdf`
- `project.zip` (entire project exported from CCS)
- `project2.zip` (if necessary)

***Lab reports are submitted on Canvas one week after the last section
of the corresponding lab.***

***Do not forget to submit your code in the submission***

# Contents

The report should broadly contain the following sections:

0.  **Checkoff sheet** contains:
    - clear photo of your checkoff sheet
1.  **Introduction** contains:
    - an overview of the procedures conducted in the lab
2.  **Background** contains:
    - a description of all modules, hardware, and software tools used
    - background information on any techniques or protocols that feature
      prominently in the lab
3.  **Goals** contains:
    - high-level descriptions of each checkoff task to complete.
      - ***each task described should include a statement on what
        concepts or techniques you should be learning as you complete
        each task***
4.  **Methods** contains:
    - implementation details for each checkoff task that you completed
      - *this includes any screenshots/images that the lab manual
        explicitly asked you to collect as part of checkoff*
      - description of software architecture used to implement firmware
        state machines, etc.
5.  **Discussion** contains:
    - challenges that were encountered during lab and how they were
      overcome
      - if they were not overcome, explain what was attempted to resolve
        them
6.  **Contributions** contains:
    - a high-level description of tasks done by each team member / how
      each member contributed to completing the lab
    - some tasks may be completed collaboratively by both team members
      - e.g. debugging, pair programming, etc.

# Quality

As upperclassmen, any part of your lab report that is hand-written
and/or hand-drawn is *unacceptable*. Block diagrams, or figures should
be included as necessary to help illustrate your concepts and show us
that you understand what the lab was about and what you learned.

For quality reports, we *strongly recommend* using a template commonly
used for writing journal articles. You can find the template files for
IEEE Transactions and ACM SIG uploaded on Canvas under `Files ->
templates`, or (if you are so inclined) you can create your report on
Overleaf using [this IEEE template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-journal-paper-template/jbbbdkztwxrd)
or [this ACM SIG template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty).
